# MATLAB Files

This repository contains MATLAB files for a biomedical engineereing design challenge focused on designing a wearable device for postpartum pregnant women in rural Georgia (U.S.). The device aims to measure vital signs, including heart raste and blood pressure.

##  Interpretation and Exploration

- 'research1.m': MATLAB code analyzes PPG sensor data from wrist and finger, featuring machine learning toolbox in MATLAB functions for data cleaning, raw sensor plots, and Beats Per Minute (BPM) calculation. Linear regression identifies blood pressure trends, and residuals guide model accuracy assessment.

Figure 1: Provides a visual of signal values changing over time, aiding in physiological insights. BPM calculation offers quick heart rate assessment, with potential for refining BPM algorithms for enhanced accuracy.

Figures 2 and 3: Generate linear regression subplots for blood pressure trends. Residual analysis identifies model shortcomings, guiding an iterative refinement process for improved accuracy. Overall, these MATLAB files offer insights into cardiovascular activity, emphasizing the importance of iterative refinement for accurate health monitoring.

##  Interpretation and Exploration

- 'statsapp10.m':  This MATLAB script performs the following statistical analyses on the clean BPM dataset:
Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, standard error, range, correlation coefficient, and linear regression coefficients.
Two-sample t-test to assess the difference between the sample mean and hypothesized population mean (from the Apple Watch).
Calculation of confidence intervals.
